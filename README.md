# Image-resizer
> I was looking for a tool to resize images when I came across [biteable](https://biteable.com)
> 
> There were a number of tools in this site in the [tools](https://biteable.com/tools/) section
> 
> One of these tools was an [image-resizer](https://biteable.com/tools/image-resizer/) that received an image and resized it for various social networks.
> 
> The site is very good, but due to the slow speed of the Internet, I started working and developed an offline version of this tool.

_This tool can still be upgraded and improved, but I did not have time to improve it_

#### How to use:
- Put this tool in the desired folder
- Drag the desired image and drop it on this tool
- Wait until the job is done

###### You must also download and install the [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows) tool before use
